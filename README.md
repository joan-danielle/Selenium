# Selenium Automation Showcase

Welcome to my repository demonstrating my skills in test automation using Selenium WebDriver. This repository contains various projects designed to showcase my ability to automate different types of web applications and testing scenarios.

## Projects Included

This repository currently includes the following projects:

* **Test:** - A basic example demonstrating login functionality and fill up on a form automation on a Heroku website.
* **TechnicalAssessment:** - This project automates a full end-to-end test flow on the Swag Labs website, covering login, adding specific and random products to the cart, verifying the cart, completing checkout, and verifying order success.

**Note:** I will be adding more projects to this repository in the future to further showcase my growing expertise in Selenium automation.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through the projects in this repository, I demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

* **Selenium WebDriver:** Proficient in using Selenium WebDriver to interact with web elements.
* **Programming Languages:** Java for writing automation scripts.
* **Test Frameworks:** Experience with integrating Selenium with testing frameworks such as JUnit for structured test execution and reporting.
* **Page Object Model (POM):** Implementation of the Page Object Model design pattern for maintainable and scalable test automation.
* **Locators:** Skillful in identifying web elements using various locators (e.g., ID, Name, XPath, CSS Selectors).
* **Handling Different UI Elements:** Ability to automate interactions with various UI elements like buttons, text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and tables.
